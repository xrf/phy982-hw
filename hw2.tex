\begin{enumerate}

\item We choose ${}^{60}_{28} \mathrm{Ni}$ as the target nucleus.  The entrance
  partition consists of the ground states of the nuclei:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For ${}^{60}_{28} \mathrm{Ni}$, the state is $0^+$.
  \item For ${}^{1}_{1} \mathrm{p}$, the state is $1/2^+$.
  \end{itemize}

\item Group directory: \verb|/projects/phy982/Group_AJ_FY|

\item \verb|projects/phy982/Group_AJ_FY/p-ni60-elastic.in| contains:

\item Without the nuclear interaction, there would be only Coulomb
  interaction.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item For point-like targets, the angular distribution would be
    that of Rutherford scattering.
  \item For finite-size targets, the angular distribution would be the product
    of Rutherford scattering with the Coulomb form factor of the target, which
    is the Fourier transform of the charge distribution into momentum space.
  \end{itemize}
